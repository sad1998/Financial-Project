#Finance Data Automation & Analysis Project

Overview

This project focuses on automating the processing and analysis of finance data received via email. Using Power Automate, Power Query, and Power BI, the data is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to extract meaningful insights. The final output is an interactive dashboard hosted on Power BI Services.

Objectives

Automate the collection and integration of finance data.

Perform efficient data transformation using Power Query.

Gain insights through data visualization and DAX calculations.

Publish and share interactive dashboards via Power BI Services.

Steps Involved

1. Automating Data Collection

Utilize Power Automate to streamline the process of aggregating multiple data files received via email.

Automatically consolidate these files into a single structured dataset.

Load the consolidated data into Power Query for further processing.

2. Data Transformation in Power Query

Perform necessary data cleaning and transformation operations.

Standardize data formats and handle missing values.

Create calculated columns and apply relevant business logic to refine the dataset.

3. Data Visualization & Analysis in Power BI

Load the transformed dataset into Power BI.

Develop interactive visualizations to explore finance trends.

Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures and aggregations.

Identify key insights such as revenue patterns, expense trends, and financial performance indicators.

4. Publishing & Dashboard Deployment

Design an interactive dashboard with key financial metrics and KPIs.

Publish the dashboard to Power BI Services for stakeholders.

Set up scheduled refreshes to keep the data up-to-date.

Provide access controls and sharing settings for seamless collaboration.
